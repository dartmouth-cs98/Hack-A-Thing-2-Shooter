# hack-a-thing-2: Unity 


## Overview
In the last hack-a-thing, We went through the process of learning React starting with a very basic tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game since we both had no previous knowledge of what React is. For this hack-a-thing, I wanted to build another game, but this time on a different platform and so we chose Unity, which I know people had a lot of success with during the first hack-a-thing. After reading/watching a couple of demos and understanding how Unity works (such as how to use textures, how to use prefabs, and a basic primer on C++), I followed a tutorial of a space-shooting game which I found interesting (link inserted below here: (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial).

This tutorial was extremely fun as it did a lot of the dirty work for you, and you were allowed to simply determine how fast the spaceship went, how many astroids came at you at once, what your shooting rate is, etc. Overall, it felt like the end-product I achieved here was much more complete than the first hack-a-thing, as the starting point was much more advanced. I also found Unity and C++ to be much more easy to use and easier to set up than the React Native enviornment that I had to use in the last hack-a-thing. Ultimately, I was able to complete the entire game, as well as make a few modifications and test a few other concepts that unfortunately I wasn't able to get to work.

## Who did what
I did this project alone. I found that there were definitely pros and cons, with the pros being you didn't have to keep on commiting onto Github, but the cons being there wasn't anyone there to catch you when you made a mistake, making coding ultimately take longer.

## What we learned
I learned a basic understanding of how to use Unity as well as how to code in C++, which I found to be very similar to Javascript. I think that this would serve me well in the future if I ever wanted to develop a game of my own. 

## What didnâ€™t work
As with most tutorials, there were a few issues with version compatability, as the tutorial was done on an older version of Unity. This meant that several lines of the script were outdated, and I had to do a lot of digging online to replace them with their newer counterparts. Additionally, I also tried to implement a couple of additional features such as multiple ships and increasing difficulty, these ultimately ended up failing.
